------ Test cases with multiple types of input ----- (codechef)

Task
Let's write a program in the IDE which performs the following

The 1st line of input contains t - the count of testcases
Each testcase consists of the following 2 lines of input
The 1st line of the testcase contains 2 integers - accept them as variables A and B
The 2nd line of the testcase contains 1 string - accept it as a variable S
For each test case, output on one line the 2 integers followed by the string

Sample 1:
Input
2
1 2
abcde
34 567
A1B2C3

Output
1 2 abcde
34 567 A1B2C3

Explanation:
Test case 1:
1 2
abcde

Output for test case 1: 1 2 abcde

Test case 2:
34 567
A1B2C3

Output for test case 2: 34 567 A1B2C3
